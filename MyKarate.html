	<p> Hey y'all! This page will give you insight on my karate. I've been doing karate since I was 5 years old. Now, I'm 15! That is a whole decade of my well currently small life. But this was not easy. It all started when I was going to a place in town with my father for somee work of his. In our town there is a school called 'Anand Vidyala' ( you can Google it). When we were passing by, I noticed karate practice being taken there. My father saw this and saw my interested eyes. The very next day he took me to the Master of the place. Even though he was a Black Belt himself, he showed himself as an ordinary man.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>My First Day</h2><br>
    <p>  The first day, it was Pramod Rathod (or as I would go on calling him 'Pramod Da') was taking the practice there. The head of the class was and still is Amol Kajale. I remember the day as clear as it was yesterday. I was doing great, better than the normal trainees that generally join! Now remember, Amol Sir has a course voice when yells so that he is audible to all. So, when he was taking the practice, he yelled so much that I started crying! I remember Kailas Dada (our then driver) came to pick me up and I went home crying. That was the first and last day that I cried there, till date. After that day, Iwas prepared for the voice and everything was great. One day, Sir announces a competition of Teakwondo. This was somewhere in November when I had joined near a month early. "Finally! Some action!" the little me thought.  </p>
	<br><h2>My first match</h2><br>
	<p> The day arrived. I was there alone cuz I did not know any of my Dada's.(we call our senior blacks who now take their classes as 'dada') My name announced and I had no idea. I mean, name is Nipun Kulkarni not Vipul Kulkarni! After that our Grand MAster(Ghanashyam Sanap Sir or as we call him Shyam Sir) called all those whose matches weren't taken. So I went. But then he explained how I missed my match. But he put me up with a red belt! I was a little intimidated as I had joined just shy of a month and did NOT even have a uniform! But i fought... I fought like my life depended on me.... I won! The second fight I lost of course but the guy was TRIPLE if not more times elder to me... I had secured a bronze medal then. I didn't get it as my sir explained my mom that it would make me stirve more to get the gold all time. Spoiler: it did. </p>
	<br><h2>My Black Belt Exam</h2><br>
    <p> Fast forward five years. I was now giving my Black belt exam. I was 10 and might as well the youngest black belt till date in our class. We were giving it in Pune. I still remember the last day was th Grand master of that place's birthday. We wished him and left for coming back to Ahmednagear. I will spare the detail of how it went but we were drenched in our own sweat, so yeah... While coming we had some free time, so we went to the Pheonix Mall there. Now, if you have been there, you would know that it has two exits: the front and back. Yeah I did not. And I learnt that the hard way. So after grabbing a meal from the McD from within the mall. I didn't want to join the others to the gaming zone so I left. From the back exit... I was lost cuz when I entered one of my Dada's was accompanying to the camp and was staying out near the entrance in case anyone came out; and now all I could see was a Garbage Van! I walked via the road thinking I would see him. I did not. But I found the toll booth of the parking. The guy was confused and asked me who I came with. I knew I could trust him but still told with my family.(to be frank, the karate is like my second life) I came abck and we came home. And I also received the belt and medal after roughly a year as it is handmade.</p>
	<br><h2>My first and last injury</h2>
    <p>This happened when I was practicing for School Games in Baramayi a couple of years ago. I kicked my opponent in the elbow. It didn't hurt then cuz I had a warm body. But when I came back home, it was pain city! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!! I was up the whole night. The next morning I skipped school as I could not walk. Later, we went to the doctor and it was a Hair-line crack. Not much major not to be messed around about either. So at the match I would've won, if only the opponent was not a wuss and an actor. So Iwas disqualified. But hey! I played, that matters more here.</p>
